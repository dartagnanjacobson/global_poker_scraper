# GP_Scraper2
This program scraps hand history data from GlobalPoker.com and stores it as a text file readable by hand databases such as Hold'em Manager or Poker Tracker. 
No GUI. Requires chrome, and user must be logged in and on the site's home page. 
Most of the main function is obsolete as the program was rewritten to use functions under the 'hand' class. Readability is greatly improved, but the main.py has not updated to remove old code.
